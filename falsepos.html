    <h2>The Doctor's Diagnosis</h2>
    <img src="images/test_image.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: auto; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"/>
    <p>A patient begins displaying symptoms of an extremely rare, terminal disease: only 0.1% of the population has it; the disease means certain death. The patient, seeking a diagnosis and treatment, goes to the doctor to have a test done. The doctor runs a test and it comes out positive.</p>
    <p> "This test is 99% accurate!" Your doctor says, "If it is positive, then it is almost certain you have the disease." </p>
    <p>Distraught, the patient arranges his will and says goodbye to his family. Yet months pass and he shows no more symptoms and does not die. Confused, he goes to
      the doctor and they realize that he had a false positive.</p>
    <p>"This test is 99% accurate!" says the Doctor, "Your false positive was so improbable!"</p>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2>But is it really?</h2>
    <p>If a test is 99% accurate, then if you tested 100 people with the illness, 99 people will get an accurate diagnosis. The accuraccy metric represents
      P(Test Positive | Diseased). If you are taking the test, what you care about is P(Diseased | Test Positive) - the likelihood that your positive result is a true positive.</p>
    <p>In fact, for some circumstances, a positive result may be <i>more likely</i> to be a false positive than a true positive. How can this be?</p>

    <h2>Let's Do Some Calculations</h2>
    <p>In the fields below, enter in the percent incidence - the percentate of the population which has the condition. In the above example, this is 0.1%. Then, enter in your test accuracy and our sample popuation. </p>
    <div id="form_wrapper"><form>
      <label for="probability">Percent Incidence: </label><input type="text" id="prob" value="0.1"/>% <br/><br/>

      <label for="population">Population: </label><input type="text" id="pop" value="100000"/>
      <input type="button" value="Calculate" id="calculate"/>
    </form></div>

    <div id="calculation">

      <p>With our inputs, we have about <b id="prob_field"></b> x <b id="pop_field2"></b> = <b id="diseased_pop"></b> people with this disease in our population. If we run our test on these people, a test that is  <b id="acc_field"></b> accurate will give us <b id="DTP"></b> true positives and
        <b id="DFN"></b> false negatives.

      <p> However, in our population, there are also <b id="pop_ND_field"></b> people who do not have the disease. If we were to apply the same test to these people, then
        <b id="acc_field2"></b> x <b id="pop_ND_calc"></b> = <b id="non_diseased_TN_field"></b> would correctly test negative. <i>However,</i>  <b id="pop_ND_false_pos"></b>
        of the non-diseased population will test positive, and here we will have false positives. </p>
      <p> As a result, if we were to test everyone in this population, we would get <b id="NDFP"></b> + <b id="DTP2"></b> = <b id="positives_field"></b> positive results, but only
          <b id="positives_percentage"></b> will be true positives. <i>Even if</i> you took this test and got a positive result, it is actually <b id="false_percentage"></b> likely that you <i>do not</i> have the disease.
    </div>

    <div id="explain">
      <h2>What happened?</h2>
      <p>In specific situations when some condition has a very low occurance rate in a population (in our example, the disease was very rare) then it is very possible when testing for the condition to get <i>more</i> false positives than true positives, despite how 'accurate' the test is proported to be. It is a fallacy
      to think that if your test is 99% accurate, your individual result is 99% accurate. </p>

      <p>In our situation, since the disease was so rare, even if we tested positive, it was still unlikely that we actually had the disease.</p>

      <p>The false positive paradox is a common issue in not only medicine, but many other fields such as criminology and biology. In fact, many surveys have revealed that <a href="http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2008/May/Goutham354.pdf">medical professionals do not completely understand this paradox</a>. </p>
